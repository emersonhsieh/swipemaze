# Swipe Maze

[Swipe Maze](http://swipemaze.com) is a game that I made between middle school and my freshman year of high school, or from June 2013 to October 2013. In the game, the player swipes on the screen for the red ball to reach the flag. 

## Rules
- The longer the player swipes, the faster the ball goes.
- Tapping the screen stops the ball at its current location.
- Spikes kill the player.
- Arrow adds impulse to the ball.

## Technologies Used
- Created with [Lua](http://lua.org) and [Corona SDK](http://coronalabs.com).
- The game uses [RevMob](http://revmob.com) and Chartboost as its monetization plaforms.

## Testing
When testing the game, move all images from the `app/images` directory to the `app` directory.
