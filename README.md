# Swipe Maze

[Swipe Maze](http://swipemaze.com) is a game that I made between middle school and my freshman year of high school, or from 2013/06 to 2013/10. In the game, the player swipes on the screen for the red ball to reach the flag. 

Rules:
- The longer the player swipes, the faster the ball goes.
- Tapping the screen stops the ball at its current location.
- Spikes kill the player.

The game uses RevMob and Chartboost as its monetization plaforms.

When testing the game, move all images from the `app/images` directory to the `app` directory.

Created with [Lua](http://lua.org) and [Corona SDK](http://coronalabs.com).
